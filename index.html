                    <p>MC Media has rolled out testing for a digital tool created to simplify music rights management. The initial testing phase has successfully onboarded 50 users. The startup introduced the tool to gather feedback from users across the music industry.</p>
                    
                    <p>The testing phase is designed to help refine the tool before a broader release, ensuring it meets the practical needs of creators. This initial testing allows the team to refine the tool based on real user input before a wider launch.</p>
                    
                    <p>The startup will announce further rollout plans after completing the testing period and implementing user feedback. As music rights management continues to grow more complex in the digital landscape, tools that simplify rights tracking and royalty management are becoming increasingly important for industry participants.</p>
                    
                    <p>The tool aims to streamline workflows for creators navigating the complexities of music rights in an evolving industry.</p>

                <div class="mobygratis-date">Date: June 1, 2025</div>

                    <p>Diana, founder of MC Media, had a meaningful conversation via Zoom with Natalie Jacobs, founder of Equalizer Consulting, about the newly released Mobygratis website and its accompanying licensing agreement.</p>
                    
                    <p>The discussion centered on Mobygratis, a platform that offers free music for primarily non-commercial purposes, including student films and NGO projects. While the initiative is marketed as having "no strings attached," the two founders highlighted several important restrictions that users should understand before downloading.</p>
                    
                    <div class="section-heading">key restriction to consider</div>
                    
                    <p>The founders explained that users must ensure their projects remain entirely free—meaning if you use Mobygratis music, your project itself must also be free and not generate any revenue. Any commercial use requires obtaining a separate license directly from Moby.</p>
                    
                    <p>Diana and Natalie emphasized the critical importance of thoroughly reading both the FAQs and the complete licensing agreement. Many users may overlook essential terms, including:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Credit requirements: Moby retains 51% of the composition rights, and proper attribution must be given</li>
                        <li>Usage boundaries: Sharing content on certain platforms may inadvertently cross into commercial territory, potentially violating the agreement</li>
                        <li>Revocation rights: The license can be terminated unilaterally by Moby at any time</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="section-heading">what users need to know</div>
                    
                    <p>Both founders cautioned that even seemingly non-commercial uses can become complicated in practice. For example, posting a student film on a monetized platform could violate the agreement's terms. They stressed that users should fully understand the licensing terms, seek clarification from Mobygratis when needed, and carefully consider how their content distribution choices might affect compliance.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite these important caveats, both Diana and Natalie praised the Mobygratis initiative as a valuable resource, particularly for educational institutions and non-profit organizations—provided users approach it with proper awareness and responsibility.</p>
